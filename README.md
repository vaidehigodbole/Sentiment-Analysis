This project, "Sentiment Analysis on Customer Feedback using NLP," leverages Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to analyze customer reviews and determine their sentiment. Using a dataset of customer reviews, the application processes the text through the VADER (Valence Aware Dictionary and sEntiment Reasoner) sentiment analyzer and TextBlob to compute sentiment scores and subjectivity. The sentiment scores are then categorized into classes such as Highly Positive, Positive, Neutral, Negative, and Highly Negative. The application, built with Streamlit, features a user-friendly interface allowing users to input their own text for real-time sentiment analysis and text cleaning. Additionally, it provides a graphical representation of sentiment score distributions and displays a sample of the processed data, offering a comprehensive tool for understanding customer sentiments in feedback.
